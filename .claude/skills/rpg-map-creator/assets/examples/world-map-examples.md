## Usage Tips

### Adapting These Examples
1. Replace specific names with your own
2. Adjust geographic features to match your world
3. Modify the theme/setting while keeping structure
4. Scale up or down as needed
5. Add or remove elements based on complexity desired

### Combining Elements
You can mix elements from different examples:
- Take the parchment style from Example 1
- Add the hazard marking approach from Example 3
- Include the decorative elements from Example 4

### Iteration Approach
Start with a base prompt from these examples, then:
1. Generate initial image
2. Identify what needs adjustment
3. Add specific descriptors for those elements
4. Regenerate with refined prompt
