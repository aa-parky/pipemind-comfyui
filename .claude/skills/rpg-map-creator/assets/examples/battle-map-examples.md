## Usage Tips for Battle Maps

### Essential Elements
- Always specify exact dimensions
- Include "square grid with 5-foot squares" (or hex grid if preferred)
- List all cover elements with positions
- Mention any elevation changes clearly
- Specify lighting conditions
- Emphasize "high contrast" and "VTT-optimized"

### Cover Types
- **Full cover:** Large trees, thick pillars, walls
- **Partial cover:** Rocks, furniture, low walls, crates
- **Difficult terrain:** Water, mud, rubble, ice

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Not specifying grid size
- Too cluttered (makes tactical play difficult)
- Poor contrast (hard to see on screen)
- Unclear elevation indicators
- Forgetting entry/exit points
