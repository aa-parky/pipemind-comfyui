### Prompt Construction for World Maps

**Essential Elements:**
- Specify "world map" or "continent map"
- Mention "top-down view" or "bird's eye view"
- Indicate style (fantasy parchment, satellite, etc.)
- List major features (mountain ranges, rivers, kingdoms)
- Specify if borders/labels should be included

**Example Structure:**
"[Fantasy/Satellite/Parchment] [world/continent] map, top-down view, showing [list major features], [style elements like aged parchment, compass rose], [color scheme], detailed cartography"

**Example Prompts:**

1. "Fantasy world map on aged parchment, top-down view, showing three major kingdoms separated by a mountain range, large central forest, coastal regions with islands, major rivers, hand-drawn style, compass rose, decorative border, warm earth tones, medieval cartography aesthetic"

## General Tips for All Map Types

### Composition

- Balance visual weight across the map
- Include negative space (don't over-clutter)
- Create focal points

### Color Usage
- Use color to distinguish different terrain/areas
- Maintain good contrast for visibility
- Consider colorblind-friendly palettes
- Colors should enhance, not confuse

### Labeling
- Clear, readable fonts
- Labels don't overlap important features
- Consistent labeling style
- Legend/key when needed

### Style Consistency
- Maintain consistent art style throughout
- Symbols should be uniform
- Scale should be consistent
- Visual language should be clear

### Practical Considerations
- Consider final use (VTT, print, display)
- Appropriate resolution for medium
- File format suitable for use
- Include any needed overlays separately (grid, labels)

### z-image turbo Specific
- Be specific about style ("fantasy map style," "tactical battle map")
- Mention "top-down view" explicitly
- Describe all major elements
- Specify color scheme
- Mention if grid is needed
- Include atmosphere/mood descriptors
- Technical specs (resolution) if needed
